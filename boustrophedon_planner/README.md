Boustrophedon Planner is a coverage path planner that implements a modified cellular decomposition algorithm. The original can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6806237/).

## Overview
The path planner is an actionlib server that takes in a `geometry_msgs/PolygonStamped` and a `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`,
and returns a `StripingPlan` message which contains a list of waypoints to stripe the passed in polygon.
